    "Rich regression is a type of regression analysis that is used when there are more independent variables than observations. It is also known as **regularized regression** or **penalized regression**. The goal of rich regression is to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function of the regression model. This penalty term is a function of the coefficients of the regression model and is designed to shrink the coefficients towards zero. This helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve its generalization performance\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a type of linear regression that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression estimates the parameters of the regression model by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values of the dependent variable. Unlike rich regression, OLS regression does not add any penalty term to the objective function of the regression model. Therefore, OLS regression can be sensitive to overfitting when there are many independent variables.\n",

On the other hand, OLS regression is used when there are fewer independent variables and does not add any penalty term to the objective function of the regression model.\n"

    "The selection of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression is a crucial step in the modeling process. The optimal value of lambda can be determined using cross-validation techniques. One such technique is k-fold cross-validation. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k subsets of equal size. The model is then trained on k-1 subsets and tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset being used as the test set exactly once. The average error across all k trials is then computed for each value of lambda, and the value of lambda that minimizes the average error is chosen as the optimal value.\n",
