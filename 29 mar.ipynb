It is similar to Ridge Regression, but instead of adding the square of the coefficients to the cost function, it adds the absolute value of the coefficients. This results in some coefficients becoming exactly zero, which makes Lasso Regression useful for feature selection \n",

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems. However, it is not a straightforward process. The Lasso Regression model is designed to work with linear models, but it can be extended to non-linear models by transforming the data into a linear form. This can be done by using a non-linear basis function to transform the input variables into a higher-dimensional space. Once the data is transformed, the Lasso Regression model can be applied to the transformed data.\n",

    "I found a discussion on Mathematics Stack Exchange that talks about using Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems. The discussion suggests that it is possible to apply Lasso Regression to non-linear regression models by linearizing the model. However, this may only provide an approximate solution in the least squares sense. The discussion also suggests that there are things that can be done if the model is non-linear because of one parameter."

In contrast, with LASSO when we increase the value of LAMBDA the most important parameters shrink a little bit and the less important parameters goes closed to ZERO.
