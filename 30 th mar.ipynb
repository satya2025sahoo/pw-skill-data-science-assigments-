    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression technique that combines the L1 and L2 regularization methods of Lasso and Ridge regression, respectively 123. It is used to overcome the limitations of these two techniques and is particularly useful when the dataset has multicollinearity issues \n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso regression, the L1 regularization method is used to shrink the coefficients of the less important features to zero. This results in a sparse model with fewer features 4. In contrast, Ridge regression uses the L2 regularization method to shrink the coefficients of all the features towards zero, but not to zero. This results in a model with all the features \n",

    "Elastic Net Regression combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge regression by using a weighted average of the L1 and L2 regularization methods 1.

    "Pickling is a process of serializing an object in Python, which means converting the object into a byte stream that can be saved to disk or sent over a network. In machine learning, pickling is used to save trained models so that they can be used later without having to retrain them. This is useful when you have a large dataset and a complex model that takes a long time to train. By pickling the model, you can save it to disk and load it later when you need to make predictions. The pickle module in Python is commonly used for this purpose .\n",
